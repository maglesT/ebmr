# Injectables: resume notes (I-1 under way, 5 November 2026)

Read these instead of the session history. The rules in force are:
- `plan.md` (approved v2);
- `platform-fit.md`;
- section 9 of the plan (the owner's and the lead's answers);
- the hard rules of `CLAUDE.md`.

## Where it stands

- **I-0** is merged (#107): the edition is data, in recipe-core 1871.
  - The edition list now has one source, from the API edition's A0 (#111):
    - SQL: `kernel.editions()` and `recipe.library_editions()`;
    - TypeScript: `EDITIONS` in `@ebmr/kernel` and `flow.EDITIONS`.
  - Take every edition name from these.
- **Control decisions** are merged (#120). The owner, via the lead, approved `control-decisions.md`:
  - 89 MODIFY, ST-68 FOLLOW, ST-69 DONT_FOLLOW;
  - recorded as each control's `expert_decision`;
  - the trace gate stays Tablets-only until I-6.
- **Checker fix** is merged (#115). The library checker refuses a calculation that reads a DATE_TIME (LIB-CALC-DATE-TIME) or a TIMER (LIB-CALC-TIMER), because the runtime evaluates neither.
- **I-1a, #114** (in CI; merge after capsules #109, under the lead's merge freeze):
  - `packages/recipe-core/src/library/seed/injectables.ts` holds 17 blocks of the `injectables` edition:
    - INJ-ROOM-READY, INJ-COMPONENT-ACCEPT, INJ-WASH, INJ-DEPYRO (tunnel), INJ-PARTS-AUTOCLAVE, INJ-COMPOUND;
    - INJ-BULK-FILTER, INJ-FILL, IPC-INJ-FILL-WEIGHT, INJ-AMPOULE-SEAL, INJ-CAPPING, INJ-TERMINAL-STERILISE;
    - INJ-VISUAL-INSPECT, INJ-CCI, INJ-UNIT-ACCOUNT, INJ-STERILITY-SAMPLE, and TEST-INJ-RELEASE (QC's).
  - They load with the existing catalogue load.
  - The installation publishes the `sterile` rule table (`INSTALLATION_RULE_TABLES`).
  - Tests: `seed-injectables.test.ts`, tagged by ST control ID.
- **#117** (in CI; merge after #109), a shared fix the lead cleared: a library block's STEP_VALUE input is read at runtime.
  - The value comes from the one COMPLETED instance of the named step (`HandlerView.stepValue`, library `readValue`).
  - It is converted exactly to the input's unit.
  - It is recorded with its origin in `computed.<field>.stepValues`.
  - `defineBatch` refuses (ENG-DEF-STEP-VALUE) a step value naming:
    - no step;
    - a step that is not earlier;
    - a step inside a loop, a replicate or an alternative branch;
    - a field not recorded once;
    - a unit that does not convert.
  - Before this fix, PROC-DISP-POTENCY (tablets) and INJ-FILL (fill volume from the bulk density) failed on the floor.

## Design choices made in I-1 (lead-approved)

- **Time limits between steps** (compounding to filtration, filling to capping, fill duration, sterilisation to use) are the master's time constraints (HOLD, PROCESS_WINDOW, USE_BY) on trusted time. They are not typed times in a block. Plan 4.3 is updated.
- **Printout values** (washer, tunnel, autoclave, terminal sterilisation) carry a CHECKED signature by a second person, per 211.68(b). There is no device gateway.
- **Terminal sterilisation:**
  - every filled tray (registered by INJ-FILL) is consumed into its numbered load;
  - each load records its cycle once, takes its own sterility samples and registers the sterilised load.
- **Visual inspection:** rejects and accepted units are calculated, and the inspection time is a timer. The inspector's eyesight and inspection qualifications are checked at signature; set them up in I-1c.
- **The disinfectant** (INJ-01) is a typed agent and lot, not a formula line.
- **Not done yet:** INJ-UNIT-ACCOUNT still types its counts. Reading them from INJ-FILL and INJ-VISUAL-INSPECT through STEP_VALUE is now possible (#117) and would remove the retyping. Consider it in I-1c (a version-2 block, or before I-1a's first approval).

## Next: I-1c, the vial and ampoule batches to release (E2E), in a fresh session

The owner's rule: the full chain works end to end — formulation from library blocks, master approval, batch, execution, packaging and labels, review, release.

**Model:** the tablets acceptance in `tools/e2e/specs/library/acceptance.ts` (S11a sandbox, S11b GMP) with `library-support.ts` (`loadCatalogue`, `approveBlocks`, `registerPlantUnits`, `addLibraryBlocks`, `runLibraryStep`). Write `tools/e2e/specs/library/injectables-acceptance.ts` and one spec file per product (vial, ampoule).

**Plant data, entered on screen as the tablets acceptance does:**
- room classes per grade (`ROOM-GRADE-C` and so on, the classes the seed examples name);
- the vial washer, tunnel, autoclave, vessel, WFI point of use, filling line, ampoule sealer, capper, inspection booth and balance as equipment, each qualified in the logbook;
- qualification types GOWNING.<grade>, APS.<line> and EYESIGHT, with valid-to dates;
- requalification as a room due date.

**Expect tablets-only wording or checks on these screens.** Each one becomes a small shared fix, tested by rule ID, sent through the lead first:
- the formula screen: "Batch size (tablets)" and "Target tablet weight";
- `createFamily`: an injectables family starts BLANK, with a dispensing stage only;
- the packaging master is a copy of a cold-form master;
- the kiosk skeleton stages.

**Release tests:** TEST-INJ-RELEASE is QC's, recorded on the lot. Release waits for it through the existing gate (D-S11-R1).

**Header:** "Batchwright Injectables" when an injectables record is on screen. Use capsules C2's mechanism (#109: `RunHeaderView.dosageForm`, `brand.Edition`). The sign-in page and the page title say just "Batchwright": declutter D3 drops the edition prop from `SignInBrand()`.

**Declutter:** the lead's rule is no new tiles, menus or screens beyond what I-1 needs.
- The namespaces in `packages/api-contract/src/disconnected.ts` answer 410 and are not called.
- Alarms and equipmentData are among them, so device and EM values stay typed into blocks.

**Done when:** a vial batch and an ampoule batch are built on screen and run to release in the sandbox.

## Rules learnt (they cost CI rounds)

- A new SQL function goes into a group in `tools/sql-mutation/src/targets.ts`, or is left out with its reason (decision 0019).
- A test tagged with a control ID is listed in that control's `tests:`. Change only the tests list, then run `pnpm -s handbook`.
- A new required field in an API view needs the fixtures to follow (`packages/api-contract/fixtures/*.json`, and the web test fixtures).
- Merging main:
  - use a merge commit, never a rebase;
  - in control YAML conflicts, keep both sides;
  - take the handbook pages from main, then regenerate them.
- Known E2E flakes until capsules #109 merges:
  - "Verify the net of OC-… (second person)" times out (own-demotab, own-p3, route-d/s/w);
  - re-run that job once.
- Calculations:
  - The library checker accepts only what the runtime evaluates. A DATE_TIME or TIMER inside a CALC is refused (#115).
  - A calculation that reads another step's value needs STEP_VALUE (#117).
- Migration numbers:
  - shared directories take the next free number, cleared with the lead;
  - `inj.*` uses 3000-3999.
